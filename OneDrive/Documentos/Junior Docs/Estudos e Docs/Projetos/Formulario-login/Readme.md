Hello, I'm just starting in the web development area and this is my first project, simple and easy in the eyes of more experienced developers and for this reason I'm open to tips as this project will be open to changes and improvements to the public.

This project is a simple login form for a fictitious company that I created to use as an example, it contains login input Name and password, remember password button for the user to stay logged in or for the password to be saved at each access and anchors that lead the user to log in via Google or Linkedin in case they don't want to create an account.
